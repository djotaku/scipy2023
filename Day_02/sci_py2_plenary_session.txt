Hypothesis - testing science tools is hard and so we need better tests. So hypothesis provides properties-based testing.

A section about how Python 3.11 is faster (10-60%, depending on code) Also better tracebacks. For Python 3.12 - f-string grammar being added. More parallelism (per-interpreter GIL).Tracing will get faster. Buffer protocol no longer needs a C extension.

A section about Dask.Memory management has been improved (especially if using Pandas) Lots of commercial tools for deploying dask (including K8s) Newest version compatible with Pandas 2.x.
