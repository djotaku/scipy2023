how can we protect vulnerable groups while measuring representation in our communities?

beause they are usually underrepresented - how do you avoid exposing what may the the only member of a group

Who is accountable for what data? Eg company, project, regulator

You can be direct (eg survey), indirect (scrape data), or guess (speaker does not recommend because it can lead to use of stereotypes)

Make sure oyu understand how consent is given or withdrawn? We usually don't consider how to withdraw (esp if anonymous survey)

With sampling - you have to be careful about defining the smallest sample you will share. (eg - don't share if you have 30-50 or less responses from a group)

During surveys - ask the minimal amount of questions. Also, 10-15 min total is best. If ask for too much - the dataset becomes more risky if exposed.
