ethical challenges:

- no one signed up to be your test subject
    - when can we assume consent?
- quantitative/qualitative OSS data is usually not subject ot IRB review
- people don't readily sit in a single dimensional cluster - we could end up erasing people or reducing folks to harmful vectors
- people from vulnerable pops may separate their identities acros smultiple online communites and spaces
    - aggregating the data may "unmask" them
- does anti-aliasing datasets peotentially create opportunities for harm for members of OSS communites?

Legal challenges
- this data is "open" - can I use it?
- this data is "public" - can I use it?
- is this fair use? (this is always changing)
- which license for what?

policy challenges:
- when does a foundatoin speak for a project? A maintainer? A community?
- can foundations "opt-in" communities an dprojects into ecosystem scale research?
