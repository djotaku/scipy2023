 
Baysian Stats with Python

speaker does not prefer black box methods

an opposite of bayesian is frequentist; ignores the past

when using prior distributions you may have more confidence in some params than others.

you also have to do regularization

Slide contains a formula that shows the relationship between the prior, likelihood, and posterior

bayes_mapvar package takes a bayesian model spec and outputs the posterir mode eistmate and posterior variance estimate

It works with a TensorFlow Probability dictionary

example uses Google's Bard to get data.


-----

Can there be too much parallelism

Immediately says yes, there can be too much parallelism.

To be more subtle - if using more than one scientific python package, they may not play well together.

vendoring your libraries is one potential solution

------

Disciplined Saddle Programming

domain specific programming for saddle programming

this is for convex optimization functions

CVXPY can solve these functions in a natural way

speaker shows many ways that you can take a 2 constraint problem into a 1 constraint problem

the conic standard form functions as an API

---------

Fast Exploration of the Milky ways

source for the analysis is a CSV file

Blosc2 can be used to compress blocks of data - we're dealing with gigabytes here

Btune plugin lets you choose between speed and compression ratio

In the datasets here - most of the bottleneck is memory bandwidth, not CPU. So single-threading of Python doesn't slow things down.

-----------

Open Force Field

they make sure to be agnostic so that reserachers can work together without revealing trade secrets

-------------

Pandera: Beyond Data Validation

speaker wanted to add types to pandas

speaker creates a pydantic-like workflow for pandas

needs more work to be fully compatible with Pandas 2.x

Thar Be Dragons: Ethical Legal Policy Challenges when Measuring Open Source

ethical challenges:

- no one signed up to be your test subject
    - when can we assume consent?
- quantitative/qualitative OSS data is usually not subject ot IRB review
- people don't readily sit in a single dimensional cluster - we could end up erasing people or reducing folks to harmful vectors
- people from vulnerable pops may separate their identities acros smultiple online communites and spaces
    - aggregating the data may "unmask" them
- does anti-aliasing datasets peotentially create opportunities for harm for members of OSS communites?

Legal challenges
- this data is "open" - can I use it?
- this data is "public" - can I use it?
- is this fair use? (this is always changing)
- which license for what?

policy challenges:
- when does a foundatoin speak for a project? A maintainer? A community?
- can foundations "opt-in" communities an dprojects into ecosystem scale research?
